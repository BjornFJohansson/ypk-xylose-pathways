    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The yeast pathway kit is a system for the in vivo assembly entire metabolic or\n",
    "other multi gene pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has three principal\n",
    "components which are combinations of DNA fragments cloned in the pCAPs positive\n",
    "selection vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pYPKa clones of terminator promoters cloned using the blunt ZraI restriction site\n",
    "2. pYPKa clones of genes to be expressed cloned using the blunt AjiI restriction site\n",
    "3. pYPKa clones of terminator promoters cloned using the blunt EcoRV restriction site\n",
    "4. pYPK0 acceptor vector\n",
    "\n",
    "### pCAPs\n",
    "\n",
    "pCAPs [Schlieper et al., 1998] is a small (3128 bp) positive selection vector for E. coli. It has the the usual ampicilllin resistance gene for selection and a collection of restriction sites in a gene encoding a toxic version of the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP. When DNA fragments are cloned within this gene, cell survival is permitted by the inactivation of the toxic CRP. Thus, there is positive selection for inserted fragments within the gene. This leads to very high frequency of correct clones in cloning experiments. pYPKa is a modified version carrying an additional AjiI restriction site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pYPKa CRP gene has the following useful restriction enzyme sites in the order they appear in the pCAPs sequence file which is the opposite direction of the transcription of the CRP gene. The positions are given as distance between cut cites of the enzymes.\n",
