## Xylose pathway constructs described in [Pereira et al. 2016](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00250)

This repository contains Jupyter notebook files describing metabolic pathways
for Saccharomyces cerevisiae D-xylose utilization and other related vectors.
The cloning strategies are expressed in [python](https://www.python.org/) code using [pydna](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna).

Most of these vectors were made using the Yeast Pathway Kit. The vectors are a part of this publication:

These notebooks are automatically tested at least once per month on the [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) 
continuous integration service. Notebook output is compared to ensure that the results are the same.
The build status is visualized by the badge below which is also a link to the build server. 
This ensures that the notebooks can be reproduced.
