## Xylose pathway constructs described in [Pereira et al. 2015](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00250)

This repository contains Jupyter notebook files describing metabolic pathways
for Saccharomyces cerevisiae D-xylose utilization and other related vectors.
The cloning strategies are expressed in [python](https://www.python.org/) code using [pydna](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna).

Most of these vectors were made using the Yeast Pathway Kit. The vectors are a part of this publication:

The [index notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BjornFJohansson/ypk-xylose-pathways/blob/master/index.ipynb)
is the place to start.

If you would like to have your own copy of this repository, the best solution is to get a 
Github account and then make your own fork. If you would like to download all files to your

These notebooks are run automatically and tested at least onve per month on the [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) 
continuous integration service. The build status is visualized by the badge below which is also a link
to the build server. This ensures that the notebooks can be reproduced.
