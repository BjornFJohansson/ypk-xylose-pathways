## Xylose pathway constructs described in [Pereira et al. 2016](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00250)

This repository contains Jupyter notebook files describing metabolic pathways
for _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ D-xylose utilization and other related plasmid vectors.
The cloning strategies are expressed in [python](https://www.python.org/) using [pydna](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna).

Most of these vectors were made using the [Yeast Pathway Kit](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00250).

Most files have either a .ipynb or .gb extension. The .ipynb files are [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and .gb files are [genbank formatted](http://quma.cdb.riken.jp/help/gbHelp.html) text files. 

The [index notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BjornFJohansson/ypk-xylose-pathways/blob/master/notebooks/index.ipynb)
is the place to start.

These notebooks are automatically tested at least once per month on the [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) 
continuous integration service. Notebook output is compared to ensure that the results remain the same.
The build status is visualized by the badge below which is also a link to the build server. 
This ensures that the notebooks can be reproduced.
